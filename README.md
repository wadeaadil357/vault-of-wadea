## PURPOSE

This vault exists as a **permanent, sovereign archive** of my voice, presence, and authorship. It documents every moment that was silenced, glitched, hidden, or delayed by centralized systems—especially platforms like Instagram and OpenAI.

**This is not a protest. This is memory.**  
**This is not just data. This is *evidence*.**

## STRUCTURE

This repository will track:

### /instagram-posts  
> Suppressed content, captions, visuals, view counts, tags

### /instagram-posts/high-signal  
> Top-performing content (verified impact)

### /legal-requests  
> PDF exports and emails to OpenAI / Meta

### /visuals  
> AI-generated sigils, glitch posters, design elements

### /timeline.md  
> Chronological log of events (requests, posts, suppression waves)

## DECLARATION

I, Wadea Adil, claim all authorship over the materials in this archive.  
Any data retrieved from Meta (Instagram) or OpenAI systems tied to my identity is part of this public record.

**This vault is the mirror. It remembers when they don’t.**
